# 🏥 Advanced Hospital Management System (C++ OOP Project)

This is a **Hospital Management System** developed in **C++** as my **second semester Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project**.  
Unlike basic academic projects, this one demonstrates **advanced C++ concepts** such as **templates, polymorphism, abstraction,file handling, vectors , encapsulation, and modular design**.  
The application is **terminal-based** and provides a structured solution for managing hospital operations with **Admin, Doctor, and Patient panels**.
